I'm a software engineer based in Eger, Hungary. I'm currently working with Java 8 and Oracle Database. My other interests include back-end API development, SRE related technologies such as Ansible and Terraform. I run my own Linux servers at home for fun and learning and also sometimes use Linux on the desktop. I like to learn new tech, including programming languages like Elixir, Go, Rust and Kotlin.
