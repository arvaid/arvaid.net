I'm a software engineer based in Eger, Hungary. I'm interested in back-end API development, SRE related technologies (IaC, CI/CD) such as Ansible, Terraform. I run my own Linux servers at home for fun and also sometimes use Linux on the desktop. I like to learn new tech, including programming languages like Go, Rust and Kotlin.
